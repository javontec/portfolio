      <h1>Biography</h1>
      <p class="text">
        Keturah Travis is an artist, performer, and teacher/choreographer born in Atlanta, GA, but found home in Chicago, IL to attend Columbia College Chicago.  Keturah is currently getting her B.F.A in Dance with a minor in American Sign Language at Columbia College Chicago.  She started dancing at the age of 3, initially being self taught, but started training in techniques within West African dance, Hip Hop, Ballet, Modern and more, professionally at 17 years old.  </p>
        
        <p class="text">She started training and performing West African dance in areas around East St. Louis, Missouri with Sunshine Cultural Arts Center at age 6.  After moving from Missouri, she then engaged with any school programs that involved movement such as step teams, cheerleading, dance programs in highschool, and even learning Urban Hip Hop choreography from Youtube creators.  When she got to Columbia College Chicago she was able to add more diversity of dance styles to her repertoire.  With training in West African dance, Hip Hop, Ballet, and Modern techniques she has been able to implement those techniques in her performance quality.  </p>
        
        <p class="text">Keturah performed in several live dance pieces that were student driven at Columbia College Chicago’s Dance Center as well.  Not only has she been able to showcase her performance abilities, but has also taken on teaching in the process.  Along with taking on everyday school work, Keturah teaches her fellow Columbia peers Hip Hop classes at Columbia’s Student Center on the weekends.  There she is able to share her own creative artistry with not only dance majors, but with different majors from all around campus.
        
        <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
        
           <p class="text">My goal as an artist is to share my knowledge, to inspire, to connect, to communicate, and to evolve while expressing my love and joy for dancing.  I believe in opportunity, curiosity, determination, and opening your mind and giving yourself more options.  I come from a background of having to create opportunities for yourself in order to live what you desire.  I’ve fused my prior self training in Hip Hop and West African technique with other styles such as Modern and Ballet, and I encourage fellow artists/students of mine to stay open and find their individuality.  I value openness and individuality the most, which are two things that compel me to create.  I feel we all learn best when variety is an option and we learn who we are through open exchanges with others, these things allow you to be true to yourself while being inspired from the atmosphere around you.
